## Week 2
### Assignment 3:
###### Describe, in exacting detail, the algorithm to give exact change. You should only assume basic arithmetic functions like addition and subtraction, but be sure to describe how to figure out what notes and coins to give back. Write this down in a new markdown file with the file extension .md (don't worry about formatting) in a Week 2 directory in your homework repo and commit/push it.

* Step 1: Subtract the price of goods and/or service from available cash. The difference between the two is the change required.

* Step 2: If the difference is 0, no change is required. If change is required, i.e. the difference between the price and available cash is larger than 0, then use exact change, i.e. as few coins (pennies, nickels, dimes, or quarters only) as possible. 

* Step 3: Identify the largest coin that can be subtracted from the required change then set aside to hand to cashier or debtor thus reducing the balance due.

* Step 4: Repeat ***Step 3*** until difference is 0. 

* Step 5: Upon completion, wish the cashier a hearty "have a good 'un."
