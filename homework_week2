Week 2
Assignment 3:
Describe, in exacting detail, the algorithm to give exact change. You should only assume basic arithmetic functions like addition and subtraction, but be sure to describe how to figure out what notes and coins to give back. Write this down in a new markdown file with the file extension .md (don't worry about formatting) in a Week 2 directory in your homework repo and commit/push it.
